# Purpose

This specification is intended to define a standardized way of communicating real-time command-and-control data and to allow data collection between control systems and / or peripheral devices.

# Scope

The scope of this document is limited to providing a payload structure and endpoint type definitions to allow basic control and data acquisition. This document does not set out to define an API but rather to specify a uniform way to build one. It does not seek to dictate endpoint names, server architecture, or security protocols.  The addition of product specific features is left to the implementer, but to be in compliance the product must support the basic set of features specified below.

# Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

# Common Concepts

There are specific concepts that all participants in this open API must support in order to make interaction possible. Each of these concepts should be driven by factory configurations or by on-site configurations made by the customer or a professional integrator.
The diagram below captures their essential relationships and cardinalities.

## Company

A company refers to a single entity that owns and / or operates one or more growing sites - i.e., greenhouses, grow chambers, farms, and so on. Each company makes its own purchasing and planning decisions and has only one set of executives.

## System

Every company (see section on Company) has one or more systems that are helping to control all activity related to agriculture. A system has a make and model number and / or a version number. Each system can own (i.e., contain or control) one or more devices. Each system should be able to report its make, model, and version. It must also be able to list the devices it owns.
Systems are not specific to location or crop (see sections on Location and Crop), since they can manage devices (see section on Device) placed in different locations and dedicated to different crops.

## Crop

A crop refers to one or more types of plants that are being grown in the same environment - i.e., if a single greenhouse is inter-planting strawberries and mint, this would be considered a single crop for the purposes of management and prediction.
All devices (see section on Device) must be able to identify the crop they are overseeing. All data produced by a device must include a crop ID for easy identification. Crop IDs do not need to be standardized, so long as they are consistent for a single company (see section on Company).
Devices can only manage a single crop, although a system (see section on System) may manage devices dedicated to different crops.

## Location

Every device (see section on Device) is placed such that it can monitor and / or affect one or more locations in the growing site. For example, a moisture sensor takes its measurements in one specific spot, whereas a light fixture affects a much larger area, and a humidifier might impact an entire greenhouse.
Each device must be able to be related to one or more locations, represented as unique IDs. This allows monitoring systems to understand the scope of the data they are receiving, as well as allowing control systems to affect areas of a crop in a consistent fashion.
Location IDs only need to be unique and consistent within a company and should be determined by the customer or a professional integrator.

## Device

A device refers to any sensor that is gathering data (light sensor, water sensor, etc) or any control mechanism that can affect the growing environment (lights, pumps, heaters, humidifiers, etc).
Every device must be related to a system, a crop, and one or more locations (see sections on System, Crop, and Location). It should also be able to report these relationships along with its own unique ID.

# Endpoint Structure

The detailed endpoint structure is outside the scope of this document because it needs to make sense for the overall architecture of the implementation. There are however a few items that need to be considered about endpoint design.

- Collection names MUST be plural.
- Individual data points SHOULD be grouped in a collection with other data points that share a physical device
- To avoid complex endpoint names, endpoints SHOULD NOT nest more than 2 collections deep (e.g., collection/{id}/collection)

# Error Handling

In principle, a successful API call should return an HTTP status code of 200. An unsuccessful API call will return an HTTP status code of 5xx and the body should contain an error code that has been properly documented by the owner of the API.
The interpretation of error codes, including the text describing the error, will be left up to the API user based on their understanding of the error code documentation provided by the API owner.

# Validation Handshake

To be specified.

Although a data consumer / receiver will have its own limits when it comes to value ranges and so on, there is a perceived need for the consumer / receiver to know what value ranges the data producer / sender might provide. This gives the consumer / receiver a secondary validation check to ensure that the data makes sense.

# Timestamps

All monitoring data MUST be accompanied by a timestamp that includes year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and time zone. The format MUST be as follows…

[year]-[month]-[day]_[hour]-[min]-[sec]_[timezone]

Here is an example of a properly formatted timestamp…

2018-01-25_04-56-05_UTC

In order to ensure consistent processing and error handling of timestamps, here are some basic rules that MUST be followed:

- The default time zone MUST be UTC
- The default seconds SHOULD be 0
- The default minutes SHOULD be the current minutes
- The default hour MUST be the current hour
- The default day MUST be the current day
- The default month MUST be the current month
- The default year MUST be the current year

# Payloads

Request and response bodies are presented below in JSON as well as YAML (which is compatible with OpenAPI 3.0).
NOTE: proper RESTful URLs should contain the identification of the entities being queries or acted upon (names or IDs) in the URL itself. Therefore, those identifications do not show up in the payloads.
