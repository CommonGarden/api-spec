| Data point | Description                                                              | Unit    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| water      | The amount of the water surrounding the roots (aquaponics & hydroponics) | %       |
| light      | The level of all spectrums of light                                      | Âµmoles  |
| temp       | The temperature of the water / air around the roots                      | celsius |
| humidity   | The level of humidity around the roots (for airponics)                   | %       |
| oxygen     | The amount of oxygen dissolved in the water** around the roots           | ppm     |
| ec         | The electrical conductivity of the water** around the roots              | Ds / m  |
| ph         | The alkalinity of the water** around the roots                           | n/a     |

**NOTE:** for airponics, water levels would be measured from the moisture in the air around the roots
